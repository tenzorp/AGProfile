# AGProfile
Sample profile page for Approachable Geek coding project. 

## Installing
1. Git clone this repo
2. within project directory, `npm install`
3. `npm start`
4. scan QR with phone (Expo app needed) or follow prompts for simulators

**A build is also available at the following link:**
https://expo.dev/@tenzorp/AGProfile <br/>
Note: the qr on this link works on Android, but will not on iOS due to Apple's iron grip on this earth and my regretful lack of an Apple Dev membership.
